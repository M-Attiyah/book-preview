              The First 20 Hours is a book about rapid skill acquisition: how to
              pick up new skills as fast as humanly possible. You can go from
              knowing absolutely nothing to performing noticeably well in a very
              short period of time: approximately 20 hours, often less.

            <h2>A Note to the Reader</h2>
            <p>
              There’s so much I want to do . . . and so little time.” The story
              of modern life. Take a moment to consider how many things you want
              to learn how to do. What’s on your list? What’s holding you back
              from getting started? Two things, most likely: time and skill.
              Here’s an uncomfortable truth: the most rewarding experiences in
              life almost always require some level of skill. Skills take time
              and effort to master—time we don’t have, and effort we’re
              reluctant to contribute. “I’ll get around to it someday, when I
              find the time.” It’s easier to sit in front of the television or
              surf the web, frankly . . . so that’s what most of us do, and our
              desires remain dreams. Here’s another uncomfortable truth: many
              things aren’t fun until you’re good at them. Every skill has what
              I call a frustration barrier—a period of time in which you’re
              horribly unskilled, and you’re painfully aware of that fact. Why
              start something when you know you’re going to be bad at it?
              Wouldn’t it be great to be able to master new skills with less
              angst? To break through the frustration barrier quickly, so you
              can get to the rewarding part? To spend less time slogging through
              confusion and doubt, and more time having fun? Is it possible to
              acquire new skills less painfully, in a way that requires far less
              time and effort? I speak from experience: yes, it’s possible. This
              book is about my personal quest to test the art and science of
              rapid skill acquisition—how to learn any new skill as quickly as
              possible. The purpose of this book is to help you acquire new
              skills in record time. In my experience, it takes around twenty
              hours of practice to break through the frustration barrier: to go
              from knowing absolutely nothing about what you’re trying to do to
              performing noticeably well. This book is a systematic approach to
              acquiring new skills as quickly as possible. The method is
              universal. It doesn’t matter whether you want to learn a language,
              write a novel, paint a portrait, start a business, or fly an
              airplane. If you invest as little as twenty hours in learning the
              basics of the skill, you’ll be surprised at how good you become.
              Whatever skill you wish to acquire, this book will help you
              acquire it in less time and with less wasted energy. With a bit of
              focused, strategic effort, you’ll find yourself performing well
              quickly, without the fist-pounding frustration. In this book,
              we’ll start with the principles of rapid skill acquisition: how to
              go about acquiring new skills as quickly as possible. These ideas
              and practices aren’t complicated, so they won’t take long to
              learn. Then, I’ll explain how to use these principles in the real
              world by showing you how I acquired the following six new skills
              in twenty hours or less each, with no more than ninety minutes of
              practice per day.

            <h2>Ten Principles of Rapid Skill Acquisition</h2>
            <p>
              Now that we’re clear about what skill acquisition really means,
              let’s examine how to do it quickly. The intent of this chapter is
              to give you a handy checklist for acquiring any new skill. I find
              it useful to think of these principles as ways to cultivate a
              “temporary obsession.” Rapid skill acquisition happens naturally
              when you become so curious and interested in something that other
              concerns fall away, at least temporarily. Think of these
              principles as ways to identify a skill worthy of temporary
              obsession, focus on it, and remove distractions or barriers that
              distract you from effective practice. Here are the ten major
              principles of rapid skill acquisition:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>Choose a lovable project.</li>
              <li>Focus your energy on one skill at a time.</li>
              <li>Define your target performance level.</li>
              <li>Deconstruct the skill into subskills.</li>
              <li>Obtain critical tools.</li>
              <li>Eliminate barriers to practice.</li>
              <li>Make dedicated time for practice.</li>
              <li>Create fast feedback loops.</li>
              <li>Practice by the clock in short bursts.</li>
              <li>Emphasize quantity and speed.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
              Many of these principles may strike you as common sense, and
              that’s okay. Remember: simply knowing these principles is not
              enough. You must actually use them to reap the rewards.
            </p>

            <h3>1. Choose a lovable project.</h3>
            <p>
              Karl Popper was one of the greatest philosophers of the twentieth
              century. He’s the guy who popularized the idea of scientific
              falsifiability. In layman’s terms, if you can’t potentially prove
              something wrong via observation or experiment, it’s not actually
              science. Popper said many wise things, but I think the following
              remark is among the wisest: “The best thing that can happen to a
              human being is to find a problem, to fall in love with that
              problem, and to live trying to solve that problem, unless another
              problem even more lovable appears.” If you want a formula for
              living a satisfying, productive life, you can’t go wrong with that
              one. Rapid skill acquisition requires choosing a lovable problem
              or project. The more excited you are about the skill you want to
              acquire, the more quickly you’ll acquire it. In practice, finding
              a lovable project is a very individual matter. For example,
              learning to speak and write Mandarin Chinese is not on my current
              list of skills to acquire because I have no urgent need to learn
              it at the moment, and I have a lot of other projects I’m more
              interested in tackling. If I decide to move to a Mandarin-speaking
              part of China in the future, it may become lovable, but I’m not
              there yet. On the other hand, I’m intensely interested in learning
              how to play Go, the world’s oldest strategic board game, which
              originated in China more than three thousand years ago. It’s a
              beautiful game, and I’ve wanted to learn how to play since I
              stumbled across it years ago. Learning to play Go requires study.
              The rules are simple, but accurately reading the evolving patterns
              of alternating black and white stones on the board is a challenge.
              Computers have dominated chess for years now, but even the best
              computers have a difficult time challenging an experienced human
              Go player. You naturally learn things you care about faster than
              things you don’t. I’m currently more interested in learning how to
              play Go, so I’m going to learn Go first, and save Mandarin for
              later. If you focus on acquiring your prime skill (that is, your
              most lovable project) before anything else, you’ll acquire it in
              far less time.
            </p>

            <h3>2. Focus your energy on one skill at a time.</h3>
            <p>
              One of the easiest mistakes to make when acquiring new skills is
              attempting to acquire too many skills at the same time. It’s a
              matter of simple math: acquiring new skills requires a critical
              mass of concentrated time and focused attention. If you only have
              an hour or two each day to devote to practice and learning, and
              you spread that time and energy across twenty different skills, no
              individual skill is going to receive enough time and energy to
              generate noticeable improvement. Internalizing this principle is
              more difficult for some people than others. Personally, I’ve
              always had a “Renaissance man” sort of temperament: there are
              hundreds of things I want to learn at any given moment, in
              hundreds of different areas. Emotionally, it’s difficult for me to
              decide to defer learning new things I discover or hear about. 1
              When I try to learn everything at once, however, I don’t really
              learn anything. Instead of making progress, I spend too much time
              switching between different skills, getting frustrated, and moving
              on to something else. That’s a recipe for extremely slow skill
              acquisition. Pick one, and only one, new skill you wish to
              acquire. Put all of your spare focus and energy into acquiring
              that skill, and place other skills on temporary hold. David Allen,
              author of Getting Things Done (2002), recommends establishing what
              he calls a “someday/maybe” list: a list of things you may want to
              explore sometime in the future, but that aren’t important enough
              to focus on right now. By adding an item to the list, you’re
              temporarily absolving yourself of responsibility for acting or
              thinking about the idea until you decide to promote it to active
              status. I can’t emphasize this enough. Focusing on one prime skill
              at a time is absolutely necessary for rapid skill acquisition.
              You’re not giving up on the other skills permanently, you’re just
              saving them for later.
            </p>

            <h3>3. Define your target performance level.</h3>
            <p>
              A target performance level is a simple sentence that defines what
              “good enough” looks like. How well would you like to be able to
              perform the skill you’re acquiring? Your target performance level
              is a brief statement of what your desired level of skill looks
              like. Think of it as a single sentence description of what you’re
              trying to achieve, and what you’ll be able to do when you’re done.
              The more specific your target performance level is, the better.
              Defining your target performance level helps you imagine what it
              looks like to perform in a certain way. Once you determine exactly
              how good you want or need to be, it’s easier to figure out how to
              get there. In the words of Charles Kettering, the inventor of the
              electric automobile ignition system: “A problem well stated is a
              problem half solved.” How you define your target performance level
              depends on why you chose to acquire the skill in the first place.
              If your intent is to have fun, your target is the point at which
              you stop feeling frustrated and start enjoying the practice
              itself. If your intent is to perform, what’s the minimum level of
              performance you’re willing to accept at first? Once you reach your
              initial target performance level, you can always choose to keep
              going if you wish. The best target performance levels seem just
              out of reach, not out of the realm of possibility. As a rule, the
              more relaxed your target performance level, the more rapidly you
              can acquire the associated skill. If you’re operating under a
              world-class mastery mind-set, this may feel like cheating: you’re
              just lowering the bar so you can “win” faster, right? That’s
              exactly what we’re doing, and it’s not cheating. Remember,
              world-class mastery is not the end point of rapid skill
              acquisition. We’re shooting for capacity and sufficiency at
              maximum speed, not perfection. It’s important to note that some
              skills have safety considerations, which you should always include
              in your target performance level. Getting hurt (or killed)
              acquiring a new skill defeats the purpose.
            </p>

            <h3>4. Deconstruct the skill into subskills.</h3>
            <p>
              Most of the things we think of as skills are actually bundles of
              smaller subskills. Once you’ve identified a skill to focus on, the
              next step is to deconstruct it—to break it down into the smallest
              possible parts. For example, playing golf is a skill that has many
              subcomponents: choosing the correct club, driving off the tee,
              hitting out of a bunker, putting, et cetera. Once the skill is
              deconstructed sufficiently, it’s much easier to identify which
              subskills appear to be most important. By focusing on the critical
              subskills first, you’ll make more progress with less effort.
              Deconstructing a skill also makes it easier to avoid feeling
              overwhelmed. You don’t have to practice all parts of a skill at
              the same time. Instead, it’s more effective to focus on the
              subskills that promise the most dramatic overall returns.
              Deconstructing the skill before you begin also allows you to
              identify the parts of the skill that aren’t important for
              beginning practitioners. By eliminating the noncritical subskills
              or techniques early in the process, you’ll be able to invest more
              of your time and energy mastering the critical subskills first.
            </p>

            <h3>5. Obtain critical tools.</h3>
            <p>
              Most skills have prerequisites to practice and performance. It’s
              difficult to play tennis if you don’t have a tennis racquet, or
              learn how to pilot a helicopter if you don’t have access to one.
              What tools, components, and environments do you need to have
              access to before you can practice efficiently? How can you obtain
              the very best tools you can find and afford? Taking a moment to
              identify critical tools before you start practicing saves precious
              time. By ensuring you have the resources you need before you
              begin, you maximize your practice time.
            </p>

            <h3>6. Eliminate barriers to practice.</h3>
            <p>
              There are many things that can get in the way of practice, which
              makes it much more difficult to acquire any skill. These barriers
              can be anything from
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Significant prepractice effort.</strong> Such as
                misplacing your tools, not acquiring the correct tools before
                practicing, or skipping setup requirements.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Intermittent resource availability.</strong> Such as
                using borrowed equipment or relying on a resource that has
                limited operating hours.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Environmental distractions.</strong> Such as television,
                ringing phones, and incoming e-mail
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Emotional blocks.</strong> Such as fear, doubt, and
                embarrassment.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              Every single one of these elements makes it harder to start
              practicing, and therefore decreases your acquisition speed.
              Relying on willpower to consistently overcome these barriers is a
              losing strategy. We only have so much willpower at our disposal
              each day, and it’s best to use that willpower wisely. The best way
              to invest willpower in support of skill acquisition is to use it
              to remove these soft barriers to practice. By rearranging your
              environment to make it as easy as possible to start practicing,
              you’ll acquire the skill in far less time.
            </p>

            <h3>7. Make dedicated time for practice</h3>
            <p>
              The time you spend acquiring a new skill must come from somewhere.
              Unfortunately, we tend to want to acquire new skills and keep
              doing many of the other activities we enjoy, like watching TV,
              playing video games, et cetera. I’ll get around to it, when I find
              the time, we say to ourselves. Here’s the truth: “finding” time is
              a myth. No one ever “finds” time for anything, in the sense of
              miraculously discovering some bank of extra time, like finding a
              twenty-dollar bill you accidentally left in your coat pocket. If
              you rely on finding time to do something, it will never be done.
              If you want to find time, you must make time. You have 24 hours to
              invest each day: 1,440 minutes, no more or less. You will never
              have more time. If you sleep approximately 8 hours a day, you have
              16 hours at your disposal. Some of those hours will be used to
              take care of yourself and your loved ones. Others will be used for
              work. Whatever you have left over is the time you have for skill
              acquisition. If you want to improve your skills as quickly as
              possible, the larger the dedicated blocks of time you can set
              aside, the better. The best approach to making time for skill
              acquisition is to identify low-value uses of time, then choose to
              eliminate them. As an experiment, I recommend keeping a simple log
              of how you spend your time for a few days. All you need is a
              notebook. The results of this time log will surprise you: if you
              make a few tough choices to cut low-value uses of time, you’ll
              have much more time for skill acquisition. The more time you have
              to devote each day, the less total time it will take to acquire
              new skills. I recommend making time for at least ninety minutes of
              practice each day by cutting low-value activities as much as
              possible. I also recommend precommitting to completing at least
              twenty hours of practice. Once you start, you must keep practicing
              until you hit the twenty-hour mark. If you get stuck, keep
              pushing: you can’t stop until you reach your target performance
              level or invest twenty hours. If you’re not willing to invest at
              least twenty hours up front, choose another skill to acquire. The
              reason for this is simple: the early parts of the skill
              acquisition process usually feel harder than they really are.
              You’re often confused, and you’ll run into unexpected problems and
              barriers. Instead of giving up when you experience the slightest
              difficulty, precommitting to twenty hours makes it easier to
              persist. Think of this approach as an exercise in grit: you’re not
              going to let some silly little issue stop you from doing what
              you’ve decided you really want to do. You’ll either solve the
              problem, or do your best until you reach the twenty-hour mark. At
              that point, you’ll be in a better position to decide how to
              proceed

            <h3>8. Create fast feedback loops.</h3>
            <p>
              <q>Fast feedback</q> means getting accurate information about how
              well you’re performing as quickly as possible. The longer it takes
              to get accurate feedback, the longer it will take to acquire the
              skill. Take the art of cheese making, for example. The subtle
              chemical processes that create fine cheeses often take months or
              years to complete, and there’s no way to rush the process without
              ruining the result. If it takes six months to determine whether or
              not your cheese is any good, the delay in feedback makes it
              difficult to acquire the skill quickly. Fast feedback naturally
              leads to rapid skill acquisition. If feedback arrives immediately,
              or with a very short delay, it’s much easier to connect that
              information to your actions and make the appropriate adjustments.
              The best forms of feedback are near instantaneous. That’s why
              skills like programming can become mildly addictive: you make a
              change, and a few milliseconds later the computer tells you
              whether or not it worked. If you don’t like the feedback (“my
              program crashed!”), make another change and try again. There are
              many potential sources of useful feedback. As Atul Gawande,
              veteran surgeon and amateur tennis player, explained in an article
              in The New Yorker, 2 experienced coaches and mentors can give you
              immediate feedback on how you’re performing and recommend
              necessary adjustments. Coaches aren’t the only source of fast
              feedback. Capture devices, like video cameras, can help you watch
              yourself as you perform. Tools like computer programs, training
              aides, and other devices can immediately indicate when you make a
              mistake or something is amiss. The more sources of fast feedback
              you integrate into your practice, the faster you’ll acquire the
              skill.
            </p>

            <h3>9. Practice by the clock in short bursts.</h3>
            <p>
              Our minds are built to learn—to notice patterns, simulate
              potential courses of action, and figure out what’s probably going
              to happen next. They’re not built to accurately estimate time—how
              long something will take, or how much time you’ve spent doing
              something. In the early phases of practicing a new skill, it’s
              very easy to overestimate how much time you’ve spent practicing.
              When you’re no good (and you know it), time seems to slow to a
              crawl, and it feels like you’ve been practicing for a longer
              period of time than you actually have. The solution for this is to
              practice by the clock. Buy a decent countdown timer 3 and set it
              for twenty minutes. There’s only one rule: once you start the
              timer, you must practice until it goes off. No exceptions. This
              simple technique will make it easier to complete longer periods of
              sustained practice, even when you get tired or frustrated. The
              more periods of sustained practice you complete, the faster your
              skill acquisition. Set aside time for three to five practice
              sessions a day, and you’ll see major progress in a very short
              period.

            <h3>10. Emphasize quantity and speed.</h3>
            <p>
              When you begin to acquire a new skill, it’s tempting to focus on
              practicing perfectly—a recipe for frustration. Your performance,
              of course, won’t be anywhere close to perfection. Instead of
              trying to be perfect, focus on practicing as much as you can as
              quickly as you can, while maintaining “good enough” form. In Art &
              Fear (2001), authors David Bayles and Ted Orland share a very
              interesting anecdote on the value of volume:
            </p>
            <p class="tap">
              The ceramics teacher announced on opening day that he was dividing
              the class into two groups. All those on the left side of the
              studio, he said, would be graded solely on the quantity of work
              they produced, all those on the right solely on its quality. His
              procedure was simple: on the final day of class he would bring in
              his bathroomscales and weigh the work of the “quantity” group:
              fifty pounds of pots rated an A, forty pounds a B, and so on.
              Those being graded on “quality,” however, needed to produce only
              one pot—albeit a perfect one—to get an A. Well, come grading time
              a curious fact emerged: the works of highest quality were all
              produced by the group being graded for quantity. It seems that
              while the “quantity” group was busily churning out piles of work
              and learning from their mistakes, the “quality” group had sat
              theorizing about perfection, and in the end had little more to
              show for their efforts than grandiose theories and a pile of dead
              clay
            </p>
            <p class="end">
              Skill is the result of deliberate, consistent practice, and in
              early-stage practice, quantity and speed trump absolute quality.
              The faster and more often you practice, the more rapidly you’ll
              acquire the skill. That’s not to say that you should ignore good
              form while practicing. Some skills, particularly skills that
              require physical actions or motions, require a certain quality of
              form to perform well. If you’re practicing your painting
              technique, going Jackson Pollack on one hundred canvases in a day
              isn’t going to help you if your aim is to paint lifelike
              portraits. Technique matters. First, ensure you’re practicing
              using form that’s good enough to satisfy your target performance
              level. Once you’re practicing in good form at least 80 to 90
              percent of the time, crank up the speed for faster skill
              acquisition. That’s it: ten simple principles that will ensure you
              go about practicing your prime skill in the most efficient and
              effective way possible.
